        "short_summary": "The team discussed improvements in domain filtering through fuzzy matching and tag-based exclusions to enhance accuracy and scalability. Ben Reeder proposed using N8N to send domain updates to Supabase, allowing flexible filtering while avoiding hard filters. Kyle Hunt raised concerns about Gmail signups requiring special logic to ensure personal emails don’t affect domain filtering. The team agreed to maintain context by keeping records involving Calendly and client data. They outlined a phased approach to automate deliverables, beginning with call data ingestion and progressing to email integration. Kyle emphasized a 24-48 hour wait post-call for follow-up emails before generating drafts, which would be reviewed by him. Integration with ClickUp was decided to ensure seamless task management, and the team prioritized developing the offer architecture deliverable first for immediate impact, while also envisioning proactive AI management of tasks.",
